* **[2024/09/20]** Our **VPC** paper has been published in ACCV 2024!

## Description
Currently, VAD is gaining attention with memory techniques that store the features of normal frames. The stored features are utilized for frame reconstruction, identifying an abnormality when a significant difference exists between the
reconstructed and input frames. However, this approach faces several challenges due to the simultaneous optimization required for both the memory and encoder-decoder model. These challenges include increased optimization difficulty, complexity of implementation, and performance variability depending on the memory size. **To address these challenges, we propose an effective memory method for VAD, called VideoPatchCore. Inspired by PatchCore, our approach introduces a structure that prioritizes memory optimization and configures three types of memory tailored to the characteristics of video data.** This method effectively addresses the limitations of existing memory-based methods, achieving good performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.
